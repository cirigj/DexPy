  desc: If one of the user's allies chose to use Grass Pledge or Water Pledge this
    turn and has not moved yet, it takes its turn immediately after the user and the
    user's move does nothing. If combined with Grass Pledge, the ally uses Fire Pledge
    with 150 power and a sea of fire appears on the target's side for 4 turns, which
    causes damage to non-Fire types equal to 1/8 of their maximum HP, rounded down,
    at the end of each turn during effect, including the last turn. If combined with
    Water Pledge, the ally uses Water Pledge with 150 power and a rainbow appears
    on the user's side for 4 turns, which doubles secondary effect chances but does
    not stack with the Serene Grace Ability. When used as a combined move, this move
    gains STAB no matter what the user's type is. This move does not consume the user's
    Fire Gem.

    with 150 power and a sea of fire appears on the target's side for 4 turns, which
    causes damage to non-Fire types equal to 1/8 of their maximum HP, rounded down,
    at the end of each turn during effect, including the last turn. If combined with
    Water Pledge, the ally uses Grass Pledge with 150 power and a swamp appears on
    the target's side for 4 turns, which quarters the Speed of each Pokemon on that
    side. When used as a combined move, this move gains STAB no matter what the user's

  desc: If the target is holding an item that can be removed from it, ignoring the
    Sticky Hold Ability, this move's power is multiplied by 1.5. If the user has not
    fainted, the target loses its held item. This move cannot remove Z-Crystals, cause
    Pokemon with the Sticky Hold Ability to lose their held item, cause Pokemon that
    can Mega Evolve to lose the Mega Stone for their species, or cause a Kyogre, a
    Groudon, a Giratina, an Arceus, a Genesect, or a Silvally to lose their Blue Orb,
    Red Orb, Griseous Orb, Plate, Drive, or Memory respectively. Items lost to this
    move cannot be regained with Recycle or the Harvest Ability.

  desc: The user swaps its Attack and Defense stats, and stat stage changes remain
    on their respective stats. This move can be used again to swap the stats back.
    If the user uses Baton Pass, the replacement will have its Attack and Defense
    stats swapped if the effect is active. If the user has its stats recalculated
    by changing forme while its stats are swapped, this effect is ignored but is still
    active for the purposes of Baton Pass.

  desc: The user takes 1/4 of its maximum HP, rounded down, and puts it into a substitute
    to take its place in battle. The substitute is removed once enough damage is inflicted
    on it, or if the user switches out or faints. Baton Pass can be used to transfer
    the substitute to an ally, and the substitute will keep its remaining HP. Until
    the substitute is broken, it receives damage from all attacks made by other Pokemon
    and shields the user from status effects and stat stage changes caused by other
    Pokemon. Sound-based moves and Pokemon with the Infiltrator Ability ignore substitutes.
    The user still takes normal damage from weather and status effects while behind
    its substitute. If the substitute breaks during a multi-hit attack, the user will
    take damage from any remaining hits. If a substitute is created while the user
    is trapped by a binding move, the binding effect ends immediately. Fails if the
    user does not have enough HP remaining to create a substitute without fainting,
    or if it already has a substitute.

    from moving, is asleep at the beginning of a turn, or the attack is not successful
    against the target on the first turn of the effect or the second turn of a three-turn

    secondary effect chances but does not stack with the Serene Grace Ability. If
    combined with Grass Pledge, the ally uses Grass Pledge with 150 power and a swamp
    appears on the target's side for 4 turns, which quarters the Speed of each Pokemon
    on that side. When used as a combined move, this move gains STAB no matter what

    this move will always hit five times. If the user is an Ash-Greninja with the
    Battle Bond Ability, this move has a power of 20 and always hits three times.

    including allies, during this turn that target all adjacent foes or all adjacent
    Pokemon. This move modifies the same 1/X chance of being successful used by other
    protection moves, where X starts at 1 and triples each time this move is successfully
    used, but does not use the chance to check for failure. X resets to 1 if this
    move fails, if the user's last move used is not Baneful Bunker, Detect, Endure,
    King's Shield, Obstruct, Protect, Quick Guard, Spiky Shield, or Wide Guard, or
    if it was one of those moves and the user's protection was broken. Fails if the
    user moves last this turn or if this move is already in effect for the user's
    side.
